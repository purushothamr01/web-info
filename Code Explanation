Code Explanation

1. Argument Parsing
The script begins by using argparse to handle command-line arguments, ensuring that the user provides a domain name.

2. WHOIS Lookup
Using the whois library, the script fetches and prints:

Domain Name
Registrar
Creation and Expiration Dates
Registrant information
Error handling is included to catch and report any issues during the lookup.

3. DNS Records Retrieval
The script utilizes dns.resolver to query:

A Records (IP addresses)
NS Records (Name servers)
MX Records (Mail servers)
TXT Records (Text records)
It collects and displays these records, again incorporating error handling for robust performance.

4. Geolocation Information
Using the requests library, the script makes a call to a geolocation API based on the domain's resolved IP address to retrieve:

Country
City
State
Latitude
Longitude
Error handling ensures that any issues with the network request are reported.

5. Shodan Search
If an IP address is provided, the script uses the shodan library to query Shodan for:

IP Address
Organization
Country
Available data about services running on that IP
An API key is required for Shodan access.

6. Output to File
If the user specifies an output file, the script saves all gathered information in a well-structured format for easy reading.
